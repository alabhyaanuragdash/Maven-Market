ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my first Power BI project built using real-world retail data as part of my learning journey!

In this dashboard, I analyzed Maven Market's performance by visualizing:
âœ… Key KPIs like Monthly Transactions, Profit & Returns
âœ… Profit Margin & Return Rate across product brands
âœ… Geo-level customer segmentation using Map & Bar Charts
âœ… Dynamic slicers for customer demographics
âœ… Top customer insights and revenue contribution
âœ… Revenue progress against targets using a Gauge chart

This project gave me hands-on experience with DAX measures, data modeling, interactive visuals, and storytelling through analytics. I'm excited to keep growing in the data analytics field! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
